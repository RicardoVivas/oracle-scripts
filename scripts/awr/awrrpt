Oracle provide two scripts to produce workload repository reports (awrrpt.sql and awrrpti.sql). 
They are similar in format to the statspack reports and give the option of HTML or plain text formats. 
The two reports give essential the same output but the awrrpti.sql allows you to select a single instance.
