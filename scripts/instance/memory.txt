1.Increase MEMORY_TARGET (also increase memory_max_target) with 25% this being a rule of thumb when getting ORA-4031 
(increasing with 10% might not be so helpful since the added amount of memory is small for this percentage).

2.Set a minimum value for shared_pool_size to 1536 MB. Officially we DO recommend setting default/explicit settings for the auto-tuned components in the SGA.

After database was up and running for a while, review data in V$MEMORY_DYNAMIC_COMPONENTS and manually assign values to the and db_cache_size at 70 or 75% of the current_size.

4.The recommendation with ASMM/AMM is set the parameter _shared_pool_reserved_pct instead of the parameter shared_pool_reserved_size. Set the shared pool reserved percent with:
alter system set "_shared_pool_reserved_pct"=10 scope=spfile;

and restart the instance.
