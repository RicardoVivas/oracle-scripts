b-tree indexes maybe used if any combinations of the leading columns of the index are used in the SQL statment.
See "introduction to Oracle9i SQL" P436



select * from v$object_usage; (it only display index of current user)
alter index INDX_HITLOG_DATE  monitoring usage
alter index INDX_HITLOG_suburl  nomonitoring usage


select 'alter index ' || index_name ||  ' monitoring usage;' from user_indexes order by 1;
select 'alter index ' || index_name ||  ' nomonitoring usage;' from user_indexes order by 1;


alter index <name> rebuild compress
