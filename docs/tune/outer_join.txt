Outer Joins

An outer join extends the result of a simple join. An outer join returns all rows that satisfy the join condition
 and also returns some or all of those rows from one table for which no rows from the other 
 satisfy the join condition.

   * To write a query that performs an outer join of tables A and B and returns all rows from A 
     (a left outer join), use the LEFT [OUTER] JOIN syntax in the FROM clause, 
     or apply the outer join operator (+) to all columns of B in the join condition in the WHERE clause. 
     For all rows in A that have no matching rows in B, Oracle Database returns null for any select 
     list expressions containing columns of B.
     
   * To write a query that performs an outer join of tables A and B and returns all rows from B (a right outer join), 
      use the RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN syntax in the FROM clause, or apply the outer join operator (+) to all columns of A
       in the join condition in the WHERE clause. 
       For all rows in B that have no matching rows in A, Oracle returns null for any select list expressions 
       containing columns of A.
       
   * To write a query that performs an outer join and returns all rows from A and B,
       extended with nulls if they do not satisfy the join condition (a full outer join), 
       use the FULL [OUTER] JOIN syntax in the FROM clause.
