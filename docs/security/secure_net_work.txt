If I set SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_SERVER = requested and SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT = rejected
 then the encryption is off for local connections & the export is faster. 
 However, there will be no encrytion between this server as a client via db link to the other database server. 
 So I cannot use this solution. Encryption is required for all connections between computers/servers in my company.
