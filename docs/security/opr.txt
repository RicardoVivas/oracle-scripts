 Oracle Password Repository
I checked this tool today :
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opr

This tool provide a simple way of not hardcoding passwords in shell scripts. Hardcoding passwords in shell scripts is a bad practice. 
The source code may be shared by many developers, may resides on unsecure servers (CVS), may be printed, etc... The passwords may change often too.

This tool uses a simple file to stores the passwords encrypted. Well, I urge you to secure this file to make it non-accessible for others.

I am not going to decode nor rate the encryption algorythm, the fact is, you do not have clear text passwords. It could be also possible to 
have clear text password in a separate text file, which would not be that less secure, but it is ugly.

To make it clear (I hope), it is a 2-ways encryption, so if you have access to the file and the source code of the algorythm, you can crack 
the password. Sounds weak? Well, Oracle Proxy Users with Internet Directory, Application Server, Portal and all those products are not much different. 
The only 100% passwordless solution I am aware of is the external OS identification.

Well, that said, let's look how it works.


# ./configure
# make
# make install



let's create the repository

 
$ export OPRREPOS=$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/oprrepos
$ opr -c



store the password for scott on LSC01


$ opr -a LSC01 SCOTT lsc
please enter the password :
please re-enter the password :
entry (LSC01, scott, lsc) added.



let's test

$ sqlplus scott/$(opr -r LSC01 SCOTT)@LSC01

This is quite convenient. I will use this to store the RMAN password to connect to the RMAN repository in my backup scripts
