And to further complicate the picture, no OS platform is certified for all of the shared storage options. For example, only Linux and SPARC Solaris are supported with NFS, and the NFS must be on a certified NAS          
Cluster Ready Services, or CRS, is a new feature in 10g. Where vendor clusterware is used, CRS interacts with the vendor clusterware to coordinate cluster membership information; without vendor clusterware, CRS, which is also known as Oracle OSD Clusterware, provides complete cluster management.
