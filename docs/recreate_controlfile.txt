Oracle always requires you to recover and then open the database with resetlogs. However you do not always need to do a resetlogs when you open the database.
If you recreate the controlfile rather than restoring a backup then Oracle allows you to open the database normally. 
Normally all information in controlfile like RMAN configuration and records, incarnation table etc will be lost so it is preferred to keep the old file.

Opening Database:

Consider a scenario where our attempt to open a database has failed. We have already restored a backup controlfile and mounted it.

SQL> alter database open noresetlogs; 
alter database open noresetlogs 
* 
ERROR at line 1: 
ORA-01588: must use RESETLOGS option for database open

Controlfile Backup:

You can make a backup of your controlfile by using below command.

SQL> alter database backup controlfile to trace  as '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/newctl.sql'; 

Incarnation Table:

The contents of the incarnation table will be lost. You can view the contents of incarnation table by running below command.

SQL> select * from v$database_incarnation;

Recreating Control File:

You can recreate the control file as long as you can generate the proper CREATE CONTROLFILE statement. 
If you know your datafile and logfile layout then you can generate this statement even with no backup of anything. 
The best way to re-create control file is with backup to trace. Continued..



First of all we will start the instance. No control file will be mounted at this stage. 
When you recreate the controlfile it will read the CONTROL_FILES initialization parameter and overwrite any existing files.

SQL> shutdown immediate; 
ORA-01109: database not open

Database dismounted. 
ORACLE instance shut down.

SQL> startup nomount 
ORACLE instance started.

SQL> CREATE CONTROLFILE REUSE DATABASE "JT10G" NORESETLOGS NOARCHIVELOG

3 MAXLOGMEMBERS 3 
4 MAXDATAFILES 100

9 GROUP 2 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/redo02.log' SIZE 50M, 
10 GROUP 3 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/redo03.log' SIZE 50M 
11 DATAFILE 
12 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/system01.dbf', 
13 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/undotbs01.dbf', 
14 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/sysaux01.dbf', 
15 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/users01.dbf', 
16 '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/example01.dbf' 
17 CHARACTER SET WE8ISO8859P1 
18 ;

Control file created.

SQL> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

Database altered.

Recreating tempfiles:

You will also need to recreate your tempfiles. The appropriate statements will be in the trace file.

SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE TEMP ADD TEMPFILE '/u04/oracle/oradata/jt10g/temp01.dbf' REUSE; 

Incarnation Table:

You can verify that all information is lost in controlfile by examining the incarnation table.

SQL> select * from v$database_incarnation; 

Final Thoughts:

To conclude I would say that this article will help you recover controlfile without a resetlogs. 
I recommend using the resetlogs and keeping the original controlfile as the incarnations will help you keep track of changes to you database.
