'su - username' to execute user's default profile. current user env dispear
'su -usename' , do not know which file to execute, but definitely not keep the current enviroment nor execute user's profile. 
'su username', seem keep current envirment and execute the login user's same type shell's profile. this is very like to when currently himselfe type in 'bash' to swith to another shell.
'su'  change to root, nothing changed!
