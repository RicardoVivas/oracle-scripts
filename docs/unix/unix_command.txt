------------- Process command -------------
  
lsof -i TCP:32768-32867
lsof -i :<number>
losf -p <pid>
 
-- To check the discrepancy of df and du,
losf -a +L1 <partition name, like /package/oracle>


/usr/sbin/fuser a.txt to find out which user is using this file
and 
pfiles <pid> to get the files opened

Files command

Find empty directory

might need /opt/csw/bin/gfind
  ﻿find . -type d --empty -exec ﻿rmdir '{}' \;


 -- find file in size order and readable format
 /usr/local/gnu/bin/ls  -lhS
 
 find . -mtime +3  -ok  rm {} \;
 find . -mtime +3  -exec  rm {} \;
 
 (a: access; m: modify; c: change
 +3: means have not be modifid within <m> days
 -3: means have be modified  within <m> days
 

 /usr/local/gnu/bin/du  --max-depth=1 -h

 scp  -S  /usr/local/bin/ssh2 /usr/local/bin/ssh2/tmp/*.dmp lock:/tmp
 or 
 scp2


GNU sed command can edit files in place (makes backup if extension supplied) using -i option. 

 sed -i 's/old-word/new-word/g' *.txt


Find out slow http response:
Use nawk on Solaris, which is better than awk 
 grep POST localhost_access_log.2007-08-22.log | grep process | awk '$6 > 5000'
 grep "13:2" formsbuilder-access.log |  awk   '$6 > 50 {print $4, $8}'

 /usr/local/gnu/bin/grep -C2 string file
 /usr/sfw/bin/ggrep -C2  "immediate" /usr/orabackup/log
 or 
 /opt/sfw/bin ....


compress file:

gtar xvfz abc.tgz


Stack trace forums
su - jboss

svcs -p forums (find out process ID)

/usr/java/bin/jstack 13384  (do this several time at short interval)

To kill the forum
kill -9 <p_id>

It should be auto restarted by svcs


------------- User Permissions -------------

To give a user access permision :  add /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
To change a local unix account:  
passwd -r files <account>
/bin/passwd -r files  oracle

/etc/shells to control ftp access

/usr/local/bin/chsh: change default shell
pwent cuscab:  to get full name 
(strec, stnam may do same thing)
 
change /etc/cron.d/cron.allow to add cron permisison
quota -v: check quota
 
etc/sudoers: contains all commands user can sudo
sudo -u oracle <cmd>

Open SSH (display remote appliation onto local host)
1.On remote server, check /etc/ssh/sshd_config : ForwardX11 (or X11Forwarding) to yes 
    and ensure remote server has open SSH installed (in all our server, no problem)
    (The X11DisplayOffset is usually  10 ) 
  Make sure not to hard code the DISPLAY=x.0 where n = 10,11 .. in the profile 
2.on client side, ssh -X usr@machine
3.after login, the $DISPLAY should be automatically set to localhost:10.0 or more
  If you login from another terminal, it should be automatically set to localhost:11.0


Shell Command
Ctrl A : beginning of line
Alt + D : delete fro cursor to end of word 
Ctrl + W : delete from cursorto beginning of word

Ctrl E : endo of line
ALT + F : move forward one word
ALT + b move backword one word

Ctrl U : delete  everyting behinde cursort to begin of line
Ctrl K : delete everything from cursort toend of line

Miscellany
 
 export JBOSS_CONSOLE=/tmp/jboss-cons
 co -l jbossmq-destinations-service.xml
 ci -u jbossmq-destinations-service.xml
 
 
 format -- p -p -- q

 telnet artemis-rsc  console  (enter two times)
 to exit: ~. ; then logout

------------- File System -------------

When run the command 
duplicate target database for standby dorecover; 
RMAN report an error:
ORA-19870: error reading backup piece /usr/orabackup/rman/9rid2vkg_1_1
ORA-19505: failed to identify file "/usr/orabackup/rman/9rid2vkg_1_1"
ORA-27054: NFS file system where the file is created or resides is not mounted with correct options

The Metalink Note:338086.1 give some explaination. 
As of Oracle 10.2 the IO interface layer in Oracle tries
        to check that the mount options of any NFS mounted disk
        used have mount options which ensure that the NFS volume
        is safe to use as incorrectly mounted NFS volumes can 
        result in data corruption problems.
        
        
Then I mounted 
mount -f nfs -o hard,fg,rsize=32768,wsize=32768 puma-private:/vol/hy_oracle /package/oracle

mount -f nfs -o vers=4,proto=tcp,hard,rsize=32768,wsize=32768 nike:/vol/vector_ora1 /usr/local/oracle/oradata1


/etc/vfstab : make nfs mount survive reboot
nfsstat -m : display nfs info

from hermes, run: 
rsync -RSCauvz -e 'ssh -x' .   medora:/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cg/.
Use -RSCauvzn to test first

1.unmount -f fileid
2.mount fileid dest_dir
3. edit /etc/vfstab file manaually

check the cron job;
/var/cron/log

on pelleas-oracle, wget is in /opt/csw/bin/wget

-- Delete empty directories
/opt/csw/bin/gfind . -type d -empty -exec rmdir "{}" \;


To test Apache config:
 /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl configtest



------------- Vi command -------------

Ctrl-G   Display line number of cursor




------------- Show all the clients connecting to port 80 (be suspicious if >15 connections per client IP address) -------------

netstat -na | grep '\.80 ' | grep EST | sort -k2

n.b. (a) note the space after '80', (b) if using this on WSOS or Files.Warwick replace "grep '\.80 '" with "egrep '\.80 |\.443 ' " to pick up SSL requests too


How's the server?

vmstat 3

Low free mem is nothing to worry about, as the ZFS cache will gobble up any spare memory,but if there's any scanning going on (SR column > 0), that's bad.

iostat -xtcnmpz 3 (ya, rly)

devices more that about 50% busy are likely to slow things down.

prstat is better than top. top lies, in zones.

prstat -L {pid} will give you a thread-level view of a process. This is super-useful for working out if jboss has just one busy thread, or lots.
prstat -Z from the global zone gives you a zone-by-zone breakdown of resource usage, which is occasionally handy on the multi-purpose boxes (maia/hyperion)


JIRAs that might have useful clues, especially if you're fighting apache:
http://bugs.elab.warwick.ac.uk/jira/browse/SSO-670 (apache problems on WSOS, aparently DNS-related)
http://bugs.elab.warwick.ac.uk/jira/browse/SBTWO-2379 (apache problems on SB2, apache leaking RAM / running out of swap)
