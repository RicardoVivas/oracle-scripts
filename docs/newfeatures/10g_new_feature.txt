What Are Those ocssd.bin Processes?
Oracle Cluster Synchronization Services (OCSSD) is a component of Oracle Cluster Ready Services (CRS) and is required for RAC 
and single-instance databases using ASM. It is installed by default, uses very few system resources, and is configured in /etc/inittab. 
These processes are started automatically each time the system boots. Oracle recommends against disabling OCSSD, even if you are not running ASM.
