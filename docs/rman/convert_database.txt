When the RMAN CONVERT DATABASE step is to be performed on the source platform, the process for transporting databases across platforms works as follows:


      In preparation for transporting the database, the source database must be opened read-only.

      SQL> STARTUP MOUNT;
      SQL> ALTER DATABASE OPEN READ ONLY;

#

Use the CHECK_DB function in the DBMS_TDB package as described in "Preparing for CONVERT DATABASE: Using the DBMS_TDB Package" to ensure that no conditions exist that would prevent the transport of the database, such as incorrect compatibility settings, in-doubt or active transactions, or incompatible endian formats between the source platform and the desired destination platform.

set serveroutput on
declare
    db_ready boolean;
  begin
    /* db_ready is ignored, but with SERVEROUTPUT set to ON any 
     * conditions preventing transport will be output to console */
    db_ready := dbms_tdb.check_db('Microsoft Windows IA (32-bit)', dbms_tdb.skip_none);
  end;
