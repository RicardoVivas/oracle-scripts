1. Delete spfile<sid>.ora, orapw<sid> lk<SID>, control files, redo logs, archives, data files
2. Instance is still running. 
3. Try to rman target / catalog <connectionString>, it failed and report "cannot open the specified controlfile"
4. Connect as sysdba, shutdown immediate and failed, reporting "cannot open the specified controlfile"
5. ABORT:  shutdown abort and rman target / catalog <connectionString>, succeed

6. DBID:   Find out the DBID from rc_database in the catalog.

7. Restore spfile
    RMAN> SET DBID=<number> ; 
    RMAN> startup nomount; 
    RMAN> restore spfile;
    
    a)you can create a link to the locations. this is much quicker than step b) 
    b) alternatively  create pfile from this spfile and modify some parameters, like file location and 
       cache size. Then re-create spfile;
    c) alter database set control_files=('c1.ctl',c2.ctl','c3.ctl') scope=spfile;
       alter system   set  db_file_name_convert=('/old1','/new1','old2','/new2') scope=spfile;
       alter system   set log_file_name_convert=('/old1','/new1','old2','/new2') scope=spfile;
       
8. Restore controlfile: 
    RMAN> shutdown abort ; 
    RMAN> startup nomount(it will use the restored spfile and restore correct controlfile name);
    RMAN> restore controlfile;
    or
    RMAN> restore controlfile from autobackup;
    
9. RMAN> alter database mount; 
     If failed and report error opening orapw file, create one: orapwd file=<home>/dbs/orapw<sid> password=<pass>
     
10. Restore database: 
    
    RMAN> report schema (It will display this info after db is mounted. Control file has such information.)
    
    Complete restore: 
    RMAN> restore database;
    
    To restore to a different location:
    run{
        set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/system01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/system01.dbf';
		set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/undotbs01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/undotbs01.dbf';
		set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/indx01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/indx01.dbf';
		set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/tools01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/tools01.dbf';
		set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/users01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/users01.dbf';
		set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/nagty01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/nagty01.dbf';
		set newname for datafile '/oracle/oradata/<sid>/progspec01.dbf' to '/oracle3/oradata/<sid>/progspec01.dbf';
		restore database;
		switch datafile all;      
       }
		
	   The sequence is: restore, switch, recover.
 
   Incomplete restore:
     restore database until time "to_date('21/07/08 9:00:00','dd/mm/yy hh24:mi:ss')";
     
11. Recover database:

    Complete recovery:
    RMAN> recover database 
    
    if the archive directory does not exists, rman will restore as archive_1_7890_444444.dbf. Otherwise, the name will be  ./archive/1_780_44444.dbf.
    You can copy more archive logs to this position and issue "recover database" again and they will be used automatically.

    Incomplete recovery:  
    To find out the archivelog back in the backupset: list backup of archivelog  { from time='sysdate -7' | all };
    recover database until sequence 4 thread 1; ( "until" implies excluding...)
    recover database until time "to_date('22/10/08 10:00:00','dd/mm/yy hh24:mi:ss')"; 
    
12. OPEN DB: 

     With Complete Recovery when online logs and all archivelogs are intact:
      RMAN> alter database open;
     
     With incomplete recovery:
      RMAN>  alter database open resetlogs;
       reporting  "new incarnation of database registered in recovery catalog starting full resync of recovery catalog"
       Remember that we do not have online redo logs before this step. Resetlog will create logs
       
13. Shutdown immediate; do a level 0 backup;


Note:

*. When do "recover database", it seems cannot find out where to stop. It always recover that last archive log from backupset. 
   Then it go for the next, which is never exist.
   This is weird. So have to use "until sequence <num> thread 1"
*. Always do a level n backup after the structure change, i.e. add new tablespace. It seems level 1 will do.
*. Always shutdown DB then do a level 0 backup after open with resetlogs. Do not do backup without restart db.
*. It maybe safe to export rman schema before recover. After recover failed, you can import backup and do a fresh recovery again.
*. Enable control file autobackup will automatically enable spfile autobackup  

  

Q: When you have to do incomplete recovery?
A: Lost of online redo logs, archivelogs. 
   Lose of control files does not necessarily means that you have to do incomplete recovery. 
   As long as the online logs are intact, you can re-create the controlfile.
