1. set ORACLE_SID
2. RMAN target /
3. set DBID = J123455;
4. startup nomount;
5.  restore spfile from  '/usr/orabackup/chusuk/rman/df_CHUSUK_7_1';
6. stop and startup nomount again
7.  restore controlfile from '/usr/orabackup/chusuk/rman/df_CHUSUK_7_1';
8. alter database mount;
9. 

rman backup log is quite useful! It stores:
a) the DBID
b) the file name that contains the controlfile, and spfile. 
   It's always in the last file of one set of backup.
