create user to be imported on target machine. Grant role webdev to it.

Step 1: Pick a Self-Contained Set of Tablespaces

The following statement can be used to determine whether tablespaces sales_1 and sales_2 are self-contained, 
with referential integrity constraints taken into consideration (indicated by TRUE).

EXECUTE DBMS_TTS.TRANSPORT_SET_CHECK('sales_1,sales_2', TRUE);
SELECT * FROM TRANSPORT_SET_VIOLATIONS;

Step 2: Generate a Transportable Tablespace Set
   1.Make all tablespaces in the set you are copying read-only.

    SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE sales_1 READ ONLY;
    SQL> ALTER TABLESPACE sales_2 READ ONLY;

   2.Invoke the Data Pump export utility on the host system and specify which tablespaces are in the transportable set.

     expdp  DUMPFILE=sales.dmp DIRECTORY=expdir  TRANSPORT_TABLESPACES = sales_1,sales_2 TRANSPORT_FULL_CHECK=Y
             

--------On target machine ---------------------------------------

Step 3: Transport the tablespace set in the target machine

      copy tablespace files to destination;
      Copy dumpfile to same Oracle directory 
            
      Copy the datafiles to the physical standby database. The data files must have the same path name on the primary and standby databases unless 
      the DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT database initialization parameter has been configured. 


Step 4: Plug In the Tablespace Set


   1.Plug in the tablespaces and integrate the structural information using the Data Pump Import utility, impdp:

   impdp / DUMPFILE=rcl.dmp DIRECTORY=pump_dir  TRANSPORT_DATAFILES=/oradata/romulus/sales_1.dbf,/oradata/romulus/sales_2.dbf REMAP_SCHEMA=(dcranney:smith) REMAP_SCHEMA=(jfee:williams)

      After this statement executes successfully, all tablespaces in the set being copied remain in read-only mode. 
      Check the import logs to ensure that no error has occurred.

    
   2.Put the tablespaces into read/write mode as follows:
     ALTER TABLESPACE sales_1 READ WRITE;
   
   3. Change the user's default tablespace. I don't think you need to grant unlimited quota on the tablespace. But wont hurt to do so.


More to consider :
1. transporting the tablespace set to a platform different to  the source platform. 
2. transporting a tablespace of a different block size
